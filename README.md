# DSL-cont 
Early project planning on a project using [Domain-specific languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) to teach mathematics in some way, likely centered around early university mathematics. 
It's based on [DSLs of Mathematics](https://Github.com/DSLsofMath/DSLsofMath) as well as [DSLs of Control Theory](https://github.com/simonhagglund/DATX02-dsl), a project resulting in a bachelors thesis. 


## Ideas for courses to implement: 
- [TMV170 - calculus](https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/8879/assignments/syllabus)
- [TMV216 - linalg](https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/7302/assignments/syllabus)
